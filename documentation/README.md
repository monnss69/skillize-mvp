7. [**Deployment & DevOps**](./07-deployment-devops.md) - Information about the deployment architecture, CI/CD pipeline, and DevOps practices.

## Diagrams

Throughout the documentation, you'll find various diagrams to help visualize the application's architecture, workflows, and component interactions. These diagrams use the Mermaid.js syntax and cover:

- Architecture diagrams
- Component relationship diagrams
- Workflow sequence diagrams
- State management diagrams
- Database entity-relationship diagrams
- Deployment architecture diagrams

## Getting Started

If you're new to the codebase, we recommend starting with the [Overview](./01-overview.md) document to understand the application's purpose and key features, followed by the [Architecture](./02-architecture.md) document to gain a high-level understanding of how the application is structured.

For developers looking to contribute to specific areas:

- **UI Development**: Start with the [Components](./03-components.md) document
- **Data Handling**: Review the [State Management](./04-state-management.md) and [Database Schema](./06-database-schema.md) documents
- **Backend Development**: Focus on the [API Documentation](./05-api-documentation.md) document
- **DevOps**: Refer to the [Deployment & DevOps](./07-deployment-devops.md) document
